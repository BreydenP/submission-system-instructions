If you get an error message, wait a few seconds, then click `Retry Repository Setup`.  If it still fails, contact emcgee@bju.edu.  If everything works, click the URL for your new repository.

### Updating an Assignment Repository

Inside the repository, there are two main buttons you'll use: `Create New File` and `Upload Files`.  Create New File allows you to create and edit a file directly in Github.  Upload allows you to upload files from your desktop.

> Note: Once a file is uploaded / created, you can edit / rename / delete the file by clicking the file, and then clicking the pencil icon at the top of the page.

### Testing an Assignment

To test an assignment, go to [Codepost](https://codepost.io) or click the `Check Submission` link at the top of the repository if your professor has not yet migrated to Codepost.  In codepost, click the course you are currently enrolled in and then click the assignment to see test results.  The code you submitted to Github should have automatically been forward to Codepost.  If it did not, you can manually upload your assignments to Codepost for testing.

If this is your first time using our testing software, you'll need to authorize the [Communicator application](https://protect.bju.edu/cps/checker/test/test) to access your Github profile (the only information accessed is your Github username).
