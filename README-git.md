# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes made to code.  It is used by numerous professional organizations and educational instituions.  It is the BJU Computer Science Department's belief that you should be exposed early and as often as possible to real-world tools that you are likely to see again in your professional career.  To this end, many of our courses use one of two Git-based submission systems.  Both systems offer a fairly limited graphical user interface for the command-line averse, but both systems can also be interacted with using the Git command line.  It is the recommendation of the department that you take time to learn Git's intricate command line interface as it fully exposes you to the power that has made Git the most popular version control system today and it exposes you to a tool built on the robust Unix philosophy of command line tools.

# Installation of Command Line Tools

### Windows

Git's command line tools can be installed on Windows using the following [installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win). It is also recommended that you install a [package manager for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/) to make it easier to install certain development tools used by our curriculum; Git can alternatively be installed using this package manager with the command: `choco install git`.

### OS X

Git is installed alongside OS X's native development tool suite.  To install the development tools, open a terminal and execute the command `xcode-select --install`.  It is also recommended that you install a [package maanger for OS X](https://brew.sh/) to make it easier to install certain development tools used by our curriculum; Git can alternatively be installed using this package manager with the command: `brew install git`.

### Linux

For Ubuntu, use apt to install Git: `sudo apt install git`.  For other distributions, see information provided by your distribution for how to use the package manager to install Git.

# Git Clients

Git's popularity means that a number of GUI tools have appeared on the market.  All of these tools expose some of the features of the Git command line via a more user-friendly interface.  Note that this list is not exhaustive, and not all options available via the command line are available in these tools so resorting to the command line to accomplish something will occassionally be necessary.
